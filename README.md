english.py contains arrays of nouns, suffixes, prefixes, prepositions and more for you to use and combine with words that fit your desired brand.

STEPS:

1. Customize the 'favorites' array with words that fit your brand, for example if you are a creative agency some words might be: creative, idea, create, future, modern, simple, agency.. etc. etc.

2. Choose from the provided functions how you want to manipulate those words. For example the function: combineArrayWithFavorites(prefixes) will place a prefix before and after each of your favorite words.

3. The function automatically checks whois data to see if the random combination has a .com availibility!
